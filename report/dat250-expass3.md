## SPA implementation ##
The frontend is built using the Reactjs framework. 
Creating a poll and voting on said poll is possible, while creating a user and linking the user to the polls and the votes will be added at a later time.
The file-structure is a bit messy, but the backend is found under the source folder, while the frontend is in its own folder.
The fetch paths are hardcoded to port 8080 at the moment, so I need to change that in the near future, but the frontend build has been added to the static folder in the backend such that everything runs through spring.

There were no major technical issues during the assignment, only some changes to backend logic to make more sense when interacting with the frontend. 
To summarize; All tasks have been completed, except from the automated build thats suggested in task 5.
